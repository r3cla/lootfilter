# LootFilter.tech

This is a "for fun" project for Path of Exile 2 inspired by the great work of NeverSink & FilterBlade using my own (messy :P) code.

It's a loot filter generator for PoE 2 (no compatibility for PoE 1). It is very straightforward and barebones but you still may encounter bugs in the early stages, this is my first time working with loot filters and I am learning as I go.

## To-do list:
- Decide how to implement Continue rule toggle for cosmetic rules
- Refactoring where necessary
- Add extra filtering options such as:
  - BaseDefencePercentile
  - StackSize (ASAP)
  - BaseArmour, BaseEnergyShield, BaseEvasion(??)
